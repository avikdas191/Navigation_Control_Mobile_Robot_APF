This project focuses on implementing an advanced navigation system using the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method for mobile robots in a university library setting. The library environment is modeled with various static and dynamic obstacles, including bookshelves, seating areas, and moving individuals, to simulate real-world scenarios. Equipped with omnidirectional drives and sonar sensors, the robots autonomously navigate the space to perform tasks such as delivering books and printouts while avoiding collisions. The APF method enables the robots to calculate attractive forces towards goals and repulsive forces from obstacles, ensuring smooth and safe navigation. The project also investigates potential applications of the APF method in warehouse logistics, hospital services, and precision agriculture, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across different environments. This work highlights my proficiency in robotics, autonomous systems, and the application of advanced navigation algorithms.
