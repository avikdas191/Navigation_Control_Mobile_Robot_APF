The project aims to implement an advanced navigation system utilizing the Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm for mobile robots in a university library environment. The library was modelled with a variety of static and dynamic obstacles, such as bookshelves, seating areas, and moving individuals, to emulate real-world conditions. The robots, fitted with omnidirectional drives and sonar sensors, autonomously traversed the space to carry out tasks like delivering books and printouts while effectively avoiding collisions. The APF method allowed the robots to compute attractive forces toward targets and repulsive forces from obstacles, ensuring smooth and safe navigation. This project also explored potential applications of the APF method in warehouse logistics, hospital services, and precision agriculture, showcasing its adaptability and efficiency across different settings. The project underscores my expertise in robotics, autonomous systems, and the implementation of sophisticated navigation algorithms.
